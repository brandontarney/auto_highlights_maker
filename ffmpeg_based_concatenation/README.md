This was an early attempt to make a simpler solution to this problem using FFmpeg. Ultimately this solution was abandoned for a python-based solution (see other sub directories). FFmpeg wasn't ideal for a number of reasons summarized by the idea that a more high-level library would allow many more features to be implemented, such as skipping duplicate frames when concatenating overlapping highlights.
